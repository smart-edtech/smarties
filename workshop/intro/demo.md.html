## Learning objective

<div class="slide-center-with-title">
There is another digital education possible. You are here to help reveal and design it.
</div>

---

## Learning objectives, round 2

- Discover why the very topic matters
- Explain what is FOSS
- Have a first experience in the use of FOSS for everyday scenarios
- Develop a personal take on the interests and challenges of FOSS for digital education
- Develop further digital skills leveraging FOSS
- Elaborate scenarios and strategies to integrate FOSS in your own context

---

## ‚ùï Warning ‚ùï

- We are not experts. We are just sharing some findings and ideas.
- FOSS is not the solution to everything.
- You may feel overwhelmed. Our goal is to make you reflect, not that you recall everything.
- This workshop may ultimately disrupt your views about education. But you are Smarties so no worries about your open-mindedness üòé

---

## Outline of the day

1. Key concepts about FOSS and FOSS in education
2. Using FOSS everyday: practical activities
3. Workshops for acquiring new skills
    1. Workshop #1
      - The power of plain text
      - AppInventor: Scratch for the mobile generation
    2. Workshop #2
      - Authoring learning content
      - Leverage FOSS in your own context
4. Bigger ideas & wrap-up

---

# First things first

Why care about FOSS as education specialists?

Why care about FOSS as citizens, just citizens?

---

## Group activity (‚è≥10 mins)

- Gather by groups of 3-4 people for the whole morning session
- Reflect on the following question and take some notes

<center>
**How did your digital practices evolve through time?**
</center>

We will have a common discussion afterwards.

---

## Digital practices happen predominantly online, but...

- EU approves ‚Ç¨2.4 billion fine against Google for abuse of dominant position. (*Le Monde*, 2021/11/10)
- CNIL fines Google ‚Ç¨50 million for non conformity with GDPR ("Que Choisir?", 2019/01/27)
- CNIL fines Microsoft ‚Ç¨60 million for not allowing users to refuse cookies ("Le Monde", 2022/12/22)
- Germany bans Windows and Microsoft Office from schools because they spy on students' data from the US ("It-Connect", 2019/07/21)

Issues: privacy, souvereignty, interoperability, obsolescence...

‚ü∂ Surrounded with more and more complex systems, we lose control...

---

## ... to the point of *surveillence capitalism*

> "The digital industry prospers thanks to an almost childlike principle: extract personal data and sell predictions of user behavior to advertisers. But for profits to grow prognosis must become certainty. To achieve this, it's no longer enough to simply predict: it's now a matter of modifying behaviour on a large scale. of modifying human behavior on a massive scale."

# FOSS: brief history and key concepts

---

## Once upon a time...

- 70s hacker culture: source code freely exchanged
- 1976: *An open letter to hobbyists*, Bill Gates
- 80s: Growing privatization of software
- 1985: Richard Stallman founds the FSF
- 1991: Start of the development of the Linux kernel
- 1998: Eric Raymond founds the OSI
- 2020: More than 128M projects on GitHub

‚ü∂ FOSS stands for Free and Open Source Software

---

## Freedoms of Free Software

*******************
* .-------------. *
*|Free to use    |*
*|---------------|*
*|Free to study  |*
*|---------------|*
*|Free to copy   |*
*|---------------|*
*|Free to modify |*
* '-------------' *
*******************

<small>After Stallman, ca. 1985</small>

## Some interesting questions to understand FOSS

- Is freeware always FOSS?
- What is the difference between Free Software and Open Source?
- Is it necessary for FOSS to make its source code available?
- Is FOSS always *gratis*?
- Who develops FOSS?
- How do companies make profit from FOSS?

---

## FOSS beyond software

- FOSS comes with a Free License
- FOSS principles beyond software
  - Creative commons
  - *Commons Based Peer Production* (CBPP): Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, OpenFoodFacts...

- FOSS is aligned with core values:
  - Technical: longevity, interoperability, decentralization, freedom of choice...
  - Philosophical: openness, communonality, ethics, independance, sharing, diversity, sovereignty...

## How many of these do you know?

# FOSS: an educational perspective

## Education & the Web

- 1990s: WWW
- Mid 2000s: Web 2.0
- Late 2000s - early 2010s: connectivism, PLE, networked student, scalable learning...
- Late 2010s: uniformization, EdTech ecosystem
- 2020: COVID-19 pandemic

## Concrete example: students learning online (G. Attwell)

**Personal Learning Environment**      |**Virtual Learning Environment**
---------------------------------------|--------------------------------
Created by the learner                 |Operated by the institution
Centered around the learner            |Geared towards expected results
Aims at learners empowerment through IT|Aims at controlling learning

## Reviving an age-old debate

<div class="slide-center-with-title">
> "[T]here was a failure to understand the role of technology in the growing commodification and managerialism in education."
>
>      -- Graham Attwell (2023)
</div>

Mechanistic vs holistic approach to education

---

## Key issues in digital education

<center>
Should digital technologies be a means of empowering students or monitoring them?

Should the use of digital technologies benefit only a few major companies?

Should the implementation of digital education be based on top-down policies or foster distributed expertise and local initiatives?
