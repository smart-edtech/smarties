# Theory: GBL vs gamification

GBL is different from gamification. Gamification is related to rewards(dopamine). It relates to **Behavorism** example: cahoot. GBL is related to self-determination theory: **Constructivism**

To build an GBL experience, you need:

1. Autonomy: choice, free movement,
2. Competent: player must feel competent(reward, ): intrinsic motivation drive
3. Sense of belonging: boost intrinsic motivation example: at the entrance hi cool to be here, create a connection


::: {.callout-tip}

The player must search the knowledge instead of just test always his knowledge.

# Practical 

> Best approach: get a game you know and add learning to it plut√¥t que le contraire.

This is why we are going to work on a 2D platform game like Mario that we are going to modify to implement the learning experience.

## 1st tutorial Platformer: Gameplay

Elements of the game:

- Characters
- Platform
- Collectables

Follow the tutorial to get a 2D game up and running.

## 2nd tutorial: Level design and learning approach

::: {.callout-tip title="Hands on"}

Add multiple levels and _replace the point gain approach by a question based
approach_.

When the player collides a collectable, a question is prompted, and
then he gets the point only if he answers correctly.
